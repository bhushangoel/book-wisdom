## Abundance and wealth
- Think thoughts of abundance and wealth.
- Our job as humans is to hold on to the thoughts of what we want, make it absolutely clear in our minds what we
want, and from that we start to invoke one of the greatest laws in the Universe, and that’s the law of attraction.
You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think about most.
- If you see it in your mind, you’re going to hold it in your hand.
- If you can think about what you want in your mind, and make that your dominant thought, you will bring it into
your life.

## Thoughts become things!
- Every thought has a frequency.
- If you’re imagining what that looks like, you’re emitting that frequency on a consistent basis.
- Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think, those thoughts are sent out into the
Universe, and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns
to the source. And that source is **You**.

## Change the frequency
- If you want to change anything in your life, change the channel and change the frequency by changing your thoughts.
- See yourself living in abundance and you will attract it. It works every time, with every person.

## Think good and focus on what you want
- The only reason why people *do not have* what they want is **because they are thinking more about what they don’t want** than what they do want. Listen to your thoughts, and listen to the words you are saying. The law is absolute and there are no mistakes.
- The law of attraction simply gives you whatever it is you are thinking about.
- The only time we are not thinking is when we are asleep; however, the forces of attraction are still operating on our last thoughts as we fall asleep. **Make your last thoughts before going to sleep good thoughts.**

## Emit that frequency
- Decide right now that you are going to think only good thoughts. At the same time, proclaim to the Universe that all your good thoughts are powerful, and that any negative thoughts are weak.
- Decide what you want to be, do, and have, think the thoughts of it, emit the frequency, and your vision will become your life.
- Your life experience is in your hands and that only all good can come into your life because that is the way you think.

## Feelings are your greatest tool
- Our feelings let us know what we’re thinking.
- Your feelings are an immediate signal for you to know what you are thinking.
- If you’re not sure how you’re feeling, just ask yourself, “How am I feeling?” You can stop and ask this question often during the day.
- Your thoughts determine your frequency, and your feelings tell you immediately what frequency you are on.
- When you celebrate the good feelings, you’ll draw to you more good feelings, and things that make you feel
good.
- When you are feeling good feelings, it is communication back from the Universe saying, **“You are thinking good thoughts.”**
